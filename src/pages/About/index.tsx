            "I started my programming journey in 2018 when joined studying the computer engineering course at Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡, it was there that I fell in love with programming. There, I learned core programming concepts like OOP, Data structure, Computer Architecture. In 2020 we were forced to stay home and all college classes were cut off, at this time I found out about Trybe's course, the course that is taking me to another programming level. Over this time at Trybe I have been developing some Web applications with and without React, from movies CRUD with route and asynchronicity to online stores using Mercado Livre API, which simulates a product purchase with rating and cart mechanisms, all done with core and advanced React concepts like component life cycle, hooks, context API.",
