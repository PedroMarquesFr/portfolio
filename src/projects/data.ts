      "In my first group project, my team used Agile Methodologies like Kanban and Scrum. In this project, I have learned that sometimes people are harder than code and that if all the group members are not on the same page, the project will fail,  but I know that the power of an organized group can be insane. The project itself is kind of an evolution of the Async Shopping Cart project, with more features, like choose the amount of each item, detail page with rate possibility, checkout page, payment methods. I refactored the code to use Redux, so now it has a better performance",
