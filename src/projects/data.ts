When i was in high school or university and had to study some content in video class youtube always recommended some unrelated videos which made it very difficult to concentrate. YT Focus removes the smart YouTube recommendation based on your tastes with anonymous queries. :D",

I also did a filter to help find the required movie and modified the original UI concept to something like Netflix",

This project was really important to practice and review styled-components, in which I was a few months away from training because of Trybe's tight schedule. I did this project at recess.",

    description:
      "In my first group project, my team used Agile Methodologies like Kanban and Scrum. In this project, I have learned that sometimes people are harder than code and that if all the group members are not on the same page, the project will mostly fail,  but I know that the power of an aligned group can be insane. The project itself is kind of an evolution of the Async Shopping Cart project, with more features, like choose the amount of each item, detail page with rate possibility, checkout page, payment methods. I refactored the code to use Redux, so now it has a better performance, I also improved the Home UI. Its aÌ¶lÌ¶mÌ¶oÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶ perfect ðŸ™ƒ, there are still some bugs and UI problems.",
